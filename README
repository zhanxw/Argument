Argument.h
==========

A simple command line argument parser by Xiaowei (zhanxw@gmail.com) 2011.


FEATURE
-------

1. Include Argument.h then we are all set.
2. Comand line flags and its documentation are kept together, and you do no need to delcare any variable
3. Store parameters to a file or restore from a file
4. Robustly handle abnormal flags such as ---flag, or misuse between - and --


TUTORIAL
---------

We explain a brief example about how to use Argument.h, you can check source code Example1.cpp and play around.

Step 1. Include Argument.h in your C++ source

Step 2. Use macros to specify command line flags.

2.1 Use BEGIN_PARAMETER_LIST(pl) to indicate a varialbe "pl" which contain interesting flags.

2.2 Then use ADD_X_PARAMETER(pl, variable_name, flag, documentation) to specify the flag.

Here, X meaning types, we support bool, int, double, std::string class;
varialbe_name is how you want to name the variable;
flag is exactly what you want to user to input in the command line;
documentation is a brief introduction about what this flag does.

In Example1.cpp, we define a bool flag -h, we want to name it as "isHelp", and its documentation 
looks like "provide help". Then the syntax is:

        ADD_BOOL_PARAMETER(pl, isHelp, "-h", "provide help")

2.3 At last use END_PARAMETER_LIST(pl) to end. 

Step 3. Parse command lines flags is easy: 

    pl.Read(argc, argv);

And when you want to check if user inputs "-h", use variable FLAG_isHelp, and its type is bool.
Basically, all variables are names in FLAG_X fashion (similar to google-flags).


Examples
--------
1. Example1.cpp 

   A simple example showing whether user specified -h flag.

2. ExampleStatus.cpp

   Automatically print out parameter status.

3. ExampleHelp.cpp

   Automatically print documentation of each flags.

4. Example2.cpp

   A complete example showing how to check flags user have specified; write parameters to a file; read parameters from a file.

FAQ
------

1. How to deal with trailing parameters (positional parameters)?

If you want to parse:

./prog arg1 arg2

You can first run:

    pl.Read(argc, argv);

Then all remaining parameters will automatically stored in std::vector<std::string> FLAG_REMAIN_ARG.

2. How to print out a status report showing which parameters are in effect?

We provide a function ParameterList.Status()
Check ExampleStatus.cpp for details

3. Why do you want user to input documentation?

We believe documentation should be close to the declearation. Therefore, our design is to keep 
variable declaration and its documentaiton in one line. The benefits are: coder knows how these flags
are supposed to use; user who checks the source code knows that too. Besides, we provide 
ParameterList.Help() function to print a help message. 
Check ExampleHelp.cpp for details

4. Why do you only support bool, int, double and std::string types?

Command line flags are just a plain texts laying in one command line, and we try to keep 
things as simple as we can. We believe these types are sufficient to deal with most command line flags.
However, let us know if you think we are wrong.

5. Do you suppose multiple argument, such as -I./a1 -I./a2 ?

We don't support that type. As we feel that may be not used often.
User can always use this syntax -I./a1,./a2 and that will make the programmig much easier.
However, if you know a scenario in which multiple argument is a must, we will try to integrate this function.
